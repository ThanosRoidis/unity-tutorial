# unity-tutorial
This is a simple introductory tutorial for the Unity Game Engine, created as part of the Technology for Games master course at UvA. It is an exact replication of the Roll-a-ball official tutorial provided by Unity, along with a presentation that goes through the implementation step by step and a few extensions for practice.
